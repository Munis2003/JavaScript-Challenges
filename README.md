# JavaScript Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various JavaScript challenges that I completed as part of a 20-day learning journey. 

I learned and practiced every concept from beginner to advanced level, such as variables, data types, operators, loops, functions, arrays, objects, classes, promises, async/await, DOM manipulation, events, APIs, and more.

I got very much motivation and inspiration from 30 Days of JavaScript, a website that offers a series of interactive challenges and projects to learn JavaScript in a fun and engaging way. I would like to thank the authour for creating such a wonderful resource.

Feel free to explore my code and see how I solved each challenge. You can also try the challenges yourself and compare your solutions with mine. I hope you find this repository useful and informative. 

Happy coding!!
